<h1>WHO IS JOSEPH W.B. DUH?</h1>
<joe>Joseph is an asian lady enthusiast, a connoisseur of history, and a specialist on how to whine. Joseph spends his days wishing for Japanese supremacy if not that then United Nations Supremacy. If that didn't convince you he's the man he is also a wonderful humanitarian; he makes sure everybody knows their place, even the white people. That's not all he is, he's also an arbiter of taste in the food industry with his favorites being ethic food not bland boring American food. Lastly Joseph is a beacon of hope for all those out there with tech issues because there's no tech issue he can't solve without google.</joe>
